# To-do-List
This is a minimalistic designed to-do list created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can input anything you need to complete in a day, week or month!

Detailed Summary:
This was the first time I utilized a Javascript function to manipulate the DOM. I was able to diplay the field user inputs as a bullet point list. I also went for a minimalistic CSS design.
